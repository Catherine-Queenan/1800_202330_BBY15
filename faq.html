              <strong>Current visitors are displayed on the park page! Just wait for your notification that you have arrived, and select the pups that you have brought with you.</strong> Each time you arrive at a dog park, your app will notify you and ask which of your pups you have brought with you today. 
              If you are just passing by, you can dismiss the message, but once you select your pup or pups, they will appear as current visitors on the park page until you
               leave. Before visiting any dog parks, you are able to check whether the pups currently visiting are a good match for your dog.

              <strong>Calvin Huang, Joyce Huang, Catherine Queenan, and Vex'ahlia DeRolo are pleased to present to you  Neighbourhood Bark!</strong> Calvin, Joyce, and Catherine are three BCIT CST Term 1 students in Set C. Vex'ahlia is Catherine's service dog, 
              who comes with her to school every day and works hard to support the team. Calvin works as the designer for the team, but also thrives working on back-end code, and enjoys a coding challenge. Joyce is the coder for the team, and really lives up to it. She 
              is incremental to the function of the application and some of its most complex components. Catherine is the project manager, who helps organize the team and the application, and works primarily on the front-end user interface. Together, they hope you enjoy 
              Neighbourhood Bark!

              <strong>As dog lovers, and with a dog in their team, BBY 15 decided to focus on helping dog owners find safe spaces for their animals.</strong> BBY 15 not only loves and cares for dogs, but they know exactly how important proper socialization is for dogs. 
              Vex'ahlia almost lost the opportunity to become a service dog due to an incident at a dog park and several at the doggy daycare that employed Catherine. In fact, it was only by careful socialization at a quiet dog park with select dogs that allowed Vex'ahlia to 
              overcome these hurdles. Knowing first-hand the damage a single poor experience at a dog park can cause, BBY 15 built Neighbourhood Bark to help other dog owners prevent similar tragedies, many of which cannot be undone as Vex'ahlia's was.

              <strong>A community driven app where dog owners work together to create a safe and vibrant community for their dogs.</strong> Dog lovers all want the best for their dogs, so BBY 15 wants Neighbourhood Bark to transfer to the hands of its 
              users, and be built upon their love and care. One day, we hope that the app will include directional services, and the ability to favourite and message your best dog buddies to organize meetups! We also hope that one day the app will allow you 
              to add your dog to any dog parks your commonly visit, so that users are not only able to see current visitors, but regulars as well.
